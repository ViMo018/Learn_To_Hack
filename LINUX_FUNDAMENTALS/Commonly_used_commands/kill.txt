Description
kill is a command-line utility used to send signals to running processes in Unix/Linux systems. It is most commonly used to stop or terminate processes by their Process ID (PID), but it can also send other signals for controlling process behavior.

Basic Syntax
kill PID

Useful Features & Flags

1. kill PID 
Sends the SIGTERM signal, which politely asks a process to terminate.
This allows the process to clean up resources before exiting.

Example:
kill 1234

2. Force Kill -9
Immediately terminates a process without allowing cleanup.
Use this only when a process does not respond to SIGTERM.

Example:
kill -9 1234

3. -l
Displays all available signal names and their corresponding numbers.

Example:
kill -l

4. -SIGSTOP 
Stops a process without terminating it.
The process can be resumed later.

Example:
kill -SIGSTOP 1234

5. -SIGCONT
Resumes a process that was previously stopped using SIGSTOP.

Example:
kill -SIGCONT 1234

6. -SIGKILL
Same as -9, but more readable and explicit.

Example:
kill -SIGKILL 1234

7. Killing Multiple Processes
You can send a signal to multiple PIDs at once.

Example:
kill 1234 5678 9012
