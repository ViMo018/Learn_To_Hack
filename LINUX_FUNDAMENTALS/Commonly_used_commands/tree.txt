Tree command:
This command is used to display the files and folders present in a directory.

For eg.
If my directory contains three folders: 
Folder1,Folder2,Folder3
Then using tree would give:
.
├── Folder1
├── Folder2
└── Folder3

which shows the folders present in my directory.

Flags:
-a :displays all files, including hidden files
-L <number> :limits the depth of the directory tree
-d :displays directories only
-f :prints the full path of each file
-h :displays file sizes in a human-readable format
