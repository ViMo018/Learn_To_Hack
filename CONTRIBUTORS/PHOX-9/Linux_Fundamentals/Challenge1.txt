Flag:
geek{grep_is_good_to_find_things_cEDf1591}

Command:
grep -o "geek{[^}]*}" file

Explanation:
grep is used to search for searching so the flag can be found using it. The flag is of the form "geek{..}" so we have to take all the characters 
between the curly braces. ^ denotes negation and placing it before } denotes that taking all characters until a '}' is encountered.
So running this command gives us the flag.
